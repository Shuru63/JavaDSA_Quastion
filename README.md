## Overview

This repository is a collection of solutions to fundamental Java programming questions and popular Data Structures and Algorithms problems. Each question is organized into its own directory and includes a Java file with a solution.

## Getting Started

To run the Java solutions in this repository, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up Java:

### 1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK)

If you don't have JDK installed, download and install the latest version from the official Oracle JDK website or use OpenJDK, which is an open-source alternative.

- **Oracle JDK:** [Download Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- **OpenJDK:** You can use package managers like `apt` or `brew` on Linux/macOS, or download from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

### 2. Verify Installation

After installation, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands to verify that Java is installed:

java -version

## Java Version
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

The solutions are written in Java. Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) [version] installed on your machine.
